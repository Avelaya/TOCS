Target-Optimized Colorimetric Sensors
This study aims to make a prediction model for dye-voc interactions. Colorimetric sensors have been used extensively for the detection of volatile organic compounds, however, the complicated chemistry behind the interaction of VOCs and the sensing elements (dyes) makes it difficult to find the best dyes. Therefore, the sensing elements are either chosen experimentally or reported in the literature.
Here we have developed a classification model using cheminformatics tools to predict the response of each dye to different VOCs. 
The architecture used here is the support vector classifier.
